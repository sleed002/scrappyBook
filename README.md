# Project-Three
Flex Froggies Group Project

## Introduction

**ScrapBook**: Create memories from birthday parties, trips to the zoo, big milestones, etc. in ScrapBook. Users can create a post (text or photo), add pictures and captions, edit their posts, and delete memories.

## Technologies

Technologies will include:

-React

-PostgresSQL

-Express

-Bootstrap and CSS


## MVP

To meet our MVP, our app will include a Home Page, an Index Page with all users, and a Create Memory Page. Once you select a User, you can see that users posts and click to view their posts. If a user wants to create a post, they can select that it is a text post and/or a photo post.
The tables we would like to create for this project include a Users Table (username, nickname, avatar, bio, favorite stuffs), a Posts Table (post title, type of post, text)

## Goals

- App Design to include CSS and Bootstrap on all pages

-Three Tables (User, Posts, AND Photos)

- Customize Post

- Add multiple photos to an entry



**Stretch Goals**

-Draw on a photo that you’ve uploaded

-Having various layout options when the user creates a post

## Struggles
<p>Some of our struggles included resolving git issues, cloudinary (image hosting site), and heroku deployment. Git issues included: merge conflicts and git rebase.  We worked through merge conflicts by collaborating with our team members. Cloudinary required a lot of prep work in terms of every group member making the .env file, adding the api and secret api key,  configuring the Cloudinary update as well as sending the correct request and receiving the correct response. We are working through our heroku deployment issues.  We learned that communication is key when working through git conflicts.</p>
