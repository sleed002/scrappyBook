# Project-Three
Flex Froggies Group Project

## Introduction

**ScrapBook**: Create memories from birthday parties, trips to the zoo, big milestones, etc. in ScrapBook. Users can create a post (text or photo), add pictures and captions, edit their posts, and delete memories.

## Technologies

Technologies will include:

-React

-PostgresSQL

-Express

-Bootstrap and CSS


## MVP

To meet our MVP, our app will include a Home Page, an Index Page with all users, and a Create Memory Page. Once you select a User, you can see that users posts and click to view their posts. If a user wants to create a post, they can select that it is a text post and/or a photo post.
The tables we would like to create for this project include a Users Table (username, nickname, avatar, bio, favorite stuffs), a Posts Table (post title, type of post, text)

## Goals

- App Design to include CSS and Bootstrap on all pages

-Three Tables (User, Posts, AND Photos)

- Customize Post

- Add multiple photos to an entry



**Stretch Goals**

-Draw on a photo that you’ve uploaded

-Having various layout options when the user creates a post
